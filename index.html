    <p>I was born in Glendora, CA on October 10, 1995. I graduated from UCR in 2017 with a Bachelor's in Marketing. 
        Shortly after graduating college, I began working in Temecula for a Marketing agency. 
        I was able to work with some of the most prestigious companies in the world. After working there for almost a year, I decided it was time to pursue a different career.
    </p>
    
    <p>I left the company in June 2018 and took some time off. I began working again in January 2019 for a different company in Norco. 
        I am currently still employed with this company.</p>
